# Karen's Adventure - Phaser RPG

Karen is a big fan of the Jonas Brothers, and now they will be in town. Help Karen to get to the concert, fight all the opposition as her mother, a ticket reseller, crazy fans, and many more to attend the supreme event.

This game was created using the framework Phaser 3 and JavaScript, I add test units with Jest and the functions are modules, best practices incorporated(ES6).

This game is optimized for desktops and tablets, mobile isn't a good experience.
